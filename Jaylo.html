        <a>Save Yourself (Japanese Version)</a>
        <p>Save yourself<br>
            Love is pain, I know too well<br>
            You've never felt waves this strong<br>
            Just save yourself<br>
            I learned to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in<br>
            Save yourself<br>
            If you're drownin' in your doubt<br>
            Save yourself<br>
            
            I'm caught up in a current, babe<br>
            Heart-break games, you won't play<br>
            It's obvious you don't need me<br>
            That's okay, drift away<br>
            
            I will trust my fate, you live your truth<br>
            I will get over it<br>
            It's obvious you don't need me<br>
            That's okay, drift away<br>
            
            Save yourself<br>
            Love is pain, I know too well<br>
            You've never felt waves this strong<br>
            Just save yourself<br>
            I learned to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in<br>
            Save yourself<br>
            If you're drownin' in your doubt<br>
            Save yourself<br>
            
            Arashi kara nigeru-kimi to<br>
            Taishō-teki hikōritsuteki na<br>
            Boku wa mada idomi tsudzukeru<br>
            Mayoi wanai kono kemuri<br>
            
            Ah, shinjita uso-kimi wa kimi<br>
            Ja shinjitsu wa nani tte?<br>
            Wakareba kurō shinai yo oh!<br>
            Kimi mo boku mo demo mada<br>
            
            Save yourself<br>
            Love is pain I know too well<br>
            You've never felt waves this strong<br>
            Just save yourself<br>
            I learned to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in<br>
            Save yourself<br>
            If you're drownin' in your doubt<br>
            Save yourself<br>
            
            If you're drownin' in your doubt<br>
            Just save yourself<br>
            
            (Drownin' in your doubt)<br>
            (Save, save)<br>
            
            Save yourself<br>
            Love is pain, I know too well<br>
            You've never felt waves this strong<br>
            Just save yourself<br>
            Agaru mo shizumu mo tsumaru tokoro jibun shidaina no<br>
            Save yourself<br>
            Koko ni iru kurainara<br>
            Save yourself<br>
